Splash State: Loads a static image (perhaps an animation, but not neccessary),
displays for a given amount of time, or until key pressed, then moves to 
Menu State.

Menu State: Allows the player the option of quitting the game, going into the 
options menu (must decide on what options avaliable), or to the choose char state.
All this should be done via buttons. State will need either a background screen,
or a background animation.

Choose Char State: This is where the players pick what characters they are going to 
play. The game will need to have a background image, and display avaliable characters
from a character data type list. It will show these chars in the form of a vertical
list, only displaying 7 at a time. It will need icons for the chars in the list. It 
will also need to display animations for the currently selected char. The player
has the option of going back to the main menu, or, once chars have been selected, 
continuing on to play the game.

Game Play State: This state will need a background image or animation (probably image),
It will need static images for game area borders. It will need to have areas for the 
main game play. It will need to have an area in the center of the screen for displaying 
the character animations.
